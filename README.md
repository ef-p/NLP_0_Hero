Notes on Karpathy NLP course


There is an excellent intro course by Karpathy that can be found here: https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html

I cannot recommend it enough. The notebooks in this repo are my recreations of his tutorials. I've added my own notes, explainations, and break downs of these concepts. While this exercise is for largely for personal edification, the notes are written in my own words and are hopefully a clear and accessible explaination of the concepts touched on in each lecture.
