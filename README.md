Notes on Karpathy NLP course


There is an excellent intro course by Karpathy that can be found here: https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html
I cannot recommend it enough. Every aspect is spelled out thoroughly. These notebooks are just my recreations of the ones he uses for his lessons.
I've coded them along while he teaches every aspect, and added my own notes, comments and explainations along the way. 
This is largely for personal edification, but hopefully anyone can find these notebooks to be a beginner friendly way to have everything spelled out for you.
I hope reading them is half as helpful as writing them has been for me.
